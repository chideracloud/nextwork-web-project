[1mGLOBAL OPTIONS[0m
       [1m--debug [22m(boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       [1m--endpoint-url [22m(string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       [1m--no-verify-ssl [22m(boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       [1m--no-paginate [22m(boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       [1m--output [22m(string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       [1m--no-sign-request [22m(boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       [1m--ca-bundle [22m(string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       [1m--cli-read-timeout [22m(int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       [1m--cli-connect-timeout [22m(int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

       [1m--cli-binary-format [22m(string)

       The formatting style to be used for binary blobs. The default format is
       base64. The base64 format expects binary blobs  to  be  provided  as  a
       base64  encoded string. The raw-in-base64-out format preserves compati-
       bility with AWS CLI V1 behavior and binary values must be passed liter-
       ally. When providing contents from a file that map  to  a  binary  blob
       [1mfileb:// [22mwill always be treated as binary and use the file contents di-
       rectly  regardless of the [1mcli-binary-format [22msetting. When using [1mfile://[0m
       the file contents will need to properly formatted  for  the  configured
       [1mcli-binary-format[22m.
